- hosts: prod
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: transfer files from data_server to all servers in prod
      ansible.posix.synchronize:
        src: /home/ubuntu/files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/
        private_key: /home/ubuntu/key.pem
      delegate_to: server1

NOTE: make sure ssh key used by rsync is present in server1, so it can send files to all other servers using rsync.
