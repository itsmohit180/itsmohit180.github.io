**Kubernetes Components**

1. Service :- static ip address, can be assigned to pod
2. Ingress :- used to route traffic
3. ConfigMap :- used for storing database endpoints
4. Secret :- used for storing db username and password
5. Volumes :- persistent store for db pod
6. Deployment :- blueprint for pods
7. StatefulSet :-

**Kubernetes Architecture**
- master node
- worker node

   (3 processes must be installed on every node) <br>
   - container runtime
   - kubelet
   - kube proxy

   (Master Node): 4 processes runs on master node <br>
   - api server
   - scheduler
   - controller manager
   - etcd

> master node :- (need less resources) <br>
> worker node :- (need more resources, does the main job of running pods)


- Production Cluster Setup :- 2-master-node, 4-worker-node 
- Test Setup :- minikube (master processes + worker processes runs in the same node) (1 node K8s cluster)
- kubectl :- command-line tool for K8s cluster
