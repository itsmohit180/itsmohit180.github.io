Kubernetes Architecture
- master node
- slave node

3 processes must be installed on every node:
container runtime
kubelet
kube proxy

Master Node: 4 processes runs on master node
api server
scheduler
controller manager
etcd

master node -> need less resources
worker node -> need more resources, does the main job of running pods


Production Cluster Setup: 2-master-node, 4-worker-node
Test Setup: minikube (master processes + worker processes runs in the same node) (1 node K8s cluster)
kubectl: command-line tool for K8s cluster
