title: CSAIL MIT 1.1 - Shell and Shell Scripting
---

Shell is what we basically use to interact with the system/kernel at low level.

Shell scripting is basically a script that we give to the system and system will perform all the tasks/commands in it one-by-one
its very useful when doing repetative tasks and to automate some executions.
