To process a lot of data and extract the useful info from it. for example log of a service or journalctl of a service.

- basic processing of a journalctl data:

> `# journalctl | grep sshd.service` <br>
> `# journalctl | grep sshd.service | grep "Disconnected from" > ssh.log`

- Sed (stream editor) edit output of the stream on the fly:

> `# journalctl | grep sshd.service | grep "Disconnected from" | sed 's/<what to replace>/<with what>/' > output.txt`

- Make arguments/run command on the sed output
usecase: in a file its written which files/dir to delete
