To process a lot of data and extract the useful info from it. for example log of a service or journalctl of a service.

**basic processing of a journalctl data:**

> `# journalctl | grep sshd.service` <br>
> `# journalctl | grep sshd.service | grep "Disconnected from" > ssh.log`

**Sed (stream editor) edit output of the stream on the fly:**

> `# journalctl | grep sshd.service | grep "Disconnected from" | sed 's/<what to replace>/<with what>/' > output.txt`

**Passing arguments on processed data**

usecase: in a log file its showing some files causing problem, some files with specific pattern

> `# cat /var/log/software1 | grep -e ".*pattern1.*" | xargs rm`
