apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

    app: mysql-service

**OBSERVATION**
<p> # kubectl exec -it mysql-0 -n project-1 -- /bin/bash <br>
manually create data in pod0 of replicaset in statefulset deployment is not reflecting on pod1 in statefulset deployment. </p>

**NOTES:**
- all pod have their own pvc and pv, first one is main - pod-0
- statefulSets assign a sticky identity, ordinal number starting from zero to n. A new Pod is created by cloning the previous Podâ€™s data. If the previous Pod is in the pending state, then the new Pod will not be created.
- if a finalizer is present like kubernetes.io/pvc-protection, pvc will not delete.
- do this to remove the finalizers, `# kubectl patch pvc mysql-persistent-storage-mysql-0 -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' -n project-1`
<br> <br>
- ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes, and it provides internal connectivity between different components of our application.

*data replication/syncing will not be handeled by statefulset you will have to use 3rd party tool for this.
