title: Kubernetes - deployment strategies
---

**Recreate Deployment:** <br>
- all existing pods will be replaced with new pods.
- downtime - yes

**Rolling Deployment:** <br>
- pod by pod, incrementally will be replaced
- downtime - no

**Blue/Green Deployment:** <br>
- blue = current, green = new version <br>
  create and test green deployment if ok route all traffic to it, if anything goes wrong route traffic back to blue deployment.
- downtime - very minimal

**Canary Deployment:** <br>
- phase wise deployment, do testing on live user
- requires using two almost identical ReplicaSets, one for all active users and another for small group of users
- downtime - no

**A/B Testing:**
- same as canary deployment, distributes traffic to different version but, <br>
  canary deployment - routes users based on traffic weight <br>
  A/B testing - can target specific users based on cookies and other parameters. <br>
- downtime - no

**Shadow Deployment:**
- same as canary deployment but, <br>
  splits traffic between current and new version without end users noticing the difference
- downtime - no
