- `# apt install python3-novaclient` - to use `# nova cli`

- `# source openrc` - for auth-url required error

- `# . openrc admin admin` - to get admin credentials, otherwise you will get http 403 error (*maybe from devstack dir not sure)

/var/log/apache2/horizon_error.log

**Error - solved** <br>
horizon is not showing now maybe because we installed something from apt and it restart systemd devstack service and now its not coming back online
and now apache is not running on port 80 ipv4 - `# netstat -nltp`

problem was in apache, it was not listening on port 80 ipv4 so, in /etc/apache2/ports.conf we gave listen 0.0.0.0:80 specifically and its now listening on ipv4

NOTE: correct way to attach network interface to instance, do not attach external interface directly, attach local interface it will go through router then external interface/subnet through floating ip <br>
*private > router > external*

**to list all host in openstack cluster** <br>
`# openstack host list`

**to set dns/nameserver in fedora** <br>
`# sudo systemd-resolve --interface wlp2s0 --set-dns 8.8.8.8 --set-domain google.com`

`in ubuntu manually create /etc/resolv.conf and add nameserver`
