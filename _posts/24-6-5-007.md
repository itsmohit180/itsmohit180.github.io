### Job Control
We can use ctrl-c to terminate current running job, but in backend it sends SIGINT signal which terminates the job.

**Some important Singnals:**

- SIGINT    &ensp; gently asks the process to stop <br>
- SIGSTOP   &ensp; stop the process now, resume it later <br>
- SIGCONT   &ensp; resume the paused process <br>
- SIGKILL   &ensp; terminate at once
