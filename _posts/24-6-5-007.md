### Job Control
We can use Ctrl-c to terminate current running job, but in backend it sends SIGINT signal which terminates the job.

**Some important Singnals:**

> SIGINT    gently asks the process to stop <br>
> SIGSTOP   stop the process now, resume it later <br>
> SIGCONT   resume the paused process <br>
> SIGKILL   terminate at once
